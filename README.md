# TensorFlow Part of Speech Tagger

Simple part of speech tagger implemented using a feedforward network in
Tensorflow.

Done as a homework project for the Natural Language Understanding course at ETH
Zurich, taught by Prof. Thomas Hofmann and Dr. Massimiliano Ciaramita. The code
is based on a template provided with the homework. (Thank you, anonymous TA!)

Work in progress.
